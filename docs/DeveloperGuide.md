## Product scope
### Target user profile

Administrative staff of hospitals who are overworked from having various responsibilities with repetitive tasks relating to doctors and patients.

### Value proposition

Aim: To facilitate the role of the administrative staff and help them automate most of the mundane tasks that they have to do. This enables the admin staff to have a one stop application to handle appointments and fees across different specialised clinics in the hospital. Administrative staff will have more time to help patients or do things that are more meaningful, such as answering queries from patients or doctors.
